            Adversity is a remarkable teacher. 
            The inception of GSR Trust took place when the COVID-19 pandemic hit our world. 
            The pandemic posed enormous challenges and disrupted human life in ways we never imagined.

    <p class="about_content-1">
        Within days of the outbreak, - our founders who have cracked many healthcare challenges
         and worked extensively for social causes - were on the ground working with healthcare 
         professionals, hospitals, and MedTech companies to do what ever it takes to lessen the
          impact of this adversity. Their extensive ground work helped them gather thoughtful 
          real-time insights in to a crisis that will define an entire generation ahead.
    </p>
    <p class="about_content-1">
        Given the scale and fury of change during the pandemic and to mount an effective 
        response, our founders actively engaged with other thought leaders, doctors, social groups,
         educators, professional networks and participated in collaborative sessions for ideas and 
         solutions to adjust to unrelenting volatility.

    <p class="about_content-1">
        The members skill fully captured lessons from their discussions and their own first-hand 
        experience as a covid warrior. They gathered insights in areas like healthcare, education,
         and employability. As a country, we faced some success stories and setbacks; our founders
          decided to take each breakdown as a challenge and use it to create a breakthrough. 
          The result is the GSRTrust.
